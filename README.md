# Healthcare Wellness & Preventive Care Portal

## Core Problem in One Line

Patients lack a simple and secure way to track preventive wellness goals, and providers lack visibility into patient compliance resulting in poor preventive care outcomes.

## Problem Overview

Today, many patients fail to meet basic wellness goals and often miss preventive health checkups. This leads to avoidable health issues, increased treatment costs, and poor long-term outcomes.
Healthcare providers also struggle to monitor patient compliance, track lifestyle goals, and access accurate patient wellness data.

There is **no simple, unified platform** that helps patients stay engaged with their wellness journey while giving providers basic visibility into preventive care compliance all in a secure and privacy-compliant manner.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

We aim to build a **Healthcare Wellness & Preventive Care Portal** that:

### For Patients:

* Makes it easy to **set and track wellness goals** (steps, hydration, exercise).
* Sends **preventive care reminders** (checkups, screenings, vaccines).
* Provides a **simple dashboard** for health goals and tips.
* Ensures **privacy and secure access** to their personal health information.

### For Healthcare Providers:

* Offers a **lightweight view of patient compliance** with wellness goals.
* Makes patient tracking simple without exposing unnecessary personal data.
* Provides tools to promote **preventive care engagement**.

## Why Is This Challenging?

* Health data must be handled **securely and privately** (HIPAA-aware).
* Needs **role-based access**: patient vs. provider.
* Must be **fast, usable, and responsive** across devices.
* Requires backend → frontend → cloud integration.
* Users expect real-time, simple dashboards and reminders.
